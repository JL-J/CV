## JUDITH LLOYD-JONES

I am a well-rounded candidate with highly developed soft skills, looking to take on a career as a junior developer in East Anglia. After working in education for several years I wanted to take on a new challenge and retrain. Since September 2018 I have been studying at Makers (https://makers.tech/), a developer bootcamp, where I have been learning fundamentals of software development through making projects. 


## Skills

#### Excellent communicator 

Throughout my professional life I have gained extensive experience of communicating with a wide variety of people from different backgrounds, including students, academics, politicians, and external stakeholders. During my time working as an English language teacher, I developed excellent verbal communication skills and learnt to adapt my language to my audience. At the University of East London, I gained experience of writing reports and servicing committees which further honed my communication skills. Most recently I have continued to develop my written communication skills by blogging (https://medium.com/@j.r.lloydjones) about my experience learning to code.
 
#### Adaptable and a fast learner

Whether it's learning a new programming language, working in a different country, or working with a new team, I am quick to adapt to any environment. Whilst working abroad I successfully navigated not only a new culture, but also a new career as an English teacher. I enjoy the opportunities and challenges that new working environments or projects bring and am undaunted by the unknown. 

#### Team player with ability to work under own initiative 

[EXAMPLE]

#### Good attention to detail

During my time working in the Higher Education sector I have developed a good eye for detail. I have been responsible for managing a number of different databases; for example as a Programme Administrator I was responsible for calculating, entering and checking student grades. This attention to detail comes through in my coding and is invaluable when searching for that one tiny bug.
