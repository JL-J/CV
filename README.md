I am a well-rounded candidate with highly developed soft skills, looking to take on a career as a junior developer in East Anglia. After working in the education sector for several years I wanted to take on a new challenge and retrain. At the end of 2018 I completed the [Makers](https://makers.tech/) developer course, where I learnt the fundamentals of software development through making projects. 

You can read more about my decision to retrain in my blog post ['Why I chose a career in Tech'](https://medium.com/@j.r.lloydjones/why-i-chose-a-career-in-tech-c33c3a3c28dc).

# Skills

#### Excellent communicator 

Throughout my professional life I have gained extensive experience of communicating with a wide variety of people from different backgrounds, including students, academics, politicians, and external stakeholders. During my time working as an English language teacher, I developed excellent verbal communication skills and learnt to adapt my language to my audience. During group projects at Makers I utilised stand-ups and retros to ensure effective communication with my teammates.
 
#### Adaptable and a fast learner

I enjoy the opportunities that new working environments bring, and I am quick to adapt to and overcome challenges. I first began learning to code in May 2018. Within seven months I have successfully built a number of web and mobile applications both individually and as part of a team.   

#### Team player with ability to work under own initiative 

A team player, I am always comfortable finding my place in a team and ensuring that collectively we meet deadlines to a high-standard of work. Whilst working at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine I volunteered to take on the responsibility of additional modules when my team was short-staffed. Although my workload increased by 50% during the spring term, due to my strong time-management skills and ability to work flexibly, I was still able to meet deadlines and offer excellent administrative support. 

#### Good attention to detail

During my time working as a Quality Assurance Officer I developed a good eye for detail through managing databases, writing reports, and reviewing documentation. This attention to detail is invaluable when searching for that one tiny bug in a program.
