I am a well-rounded candidate with highly developed soft skills, looking to take on a career as a junior developer in East Anglia. After working in education for several years I wanted to take on a new challenge and retrain. Since September 2018 I have been studying at Makers (https://makers.tech/), a developer bootcamp, where I have been learning fundamentals of software development through making projects. 

You can read more about my desicion to retrain in my blog post ['Why I chose a career in Tech'](https://medium.com/@j.r.lloydjones/why-i-chose-a-career-in-tech-c33c3a3c28dc).

# Skills

#### Excellent communicator 

Throughout my professional life I have gained extensive experience of communicating with a wide variety of people from different backgrounds, including students, academics, politicians, and external stakeholders. During my time working as an English language teacher, I developed excellent verbal communication skills and learnt to adapt my language to my audience. Most recently I have continued to develop my written communication skills by blogging (https://medium.com/@j.r.lloydjones) about my experience learning to code.
 
#### Adaptable and a fast learner

Whether it's learning a new programming language, working in a different country, or working with a new team, I am quick to adapt to any environment. Whilst working abroad I successfully navigated not only a new culture, but also a new career as an English teacher. I enjoy the opportunities and challenges that new working environments or projects bring and am undaunted by the unknown. 

#### Team player with ability to work under own initiative 

A team player, I am always comfortable finding my place in a team and ensuring that collectively we meet deadlines to a high-standard of work. Whilst working at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine I volunteered to take on the responsibility of additional modules when my team was short-staffed. Although my workload increased by 50% during the spring term, due to my strong time-management skills and ability to work flexibly, I was still able to meet deadlines and offer excellent administrative support. 

#### Good attention to detail

During my time working in the Higher Education sector I have developed a good eye for detail through managing databases and writing reports. This attention to detail comes through in my coding and is invaluable when searching for that one tiny bug.
