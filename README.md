## Judith Lloyd-Jones

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator 

Throughout my professional life I have gained extensive experience of communicating with a wide variety of people from different backgrounds, including students, academics, politicians, and external stakeholders. During my time working as an English language teacher, I developed excellent verbal communication skills and learnt to adapt my language to my audience. At the University of East London I gained experience of writing reports and servicing committees which further honed my communication skills. Most recently I have continued to develop my written communication skills by blogging (https://medium.com/@j.r.lloydjones) about my experience learning to code.
 
#### Adaptable and a fast learner

Whether it's learning a new programming language, working in a different country, or working with a new team, I am quick to adapt to any environment. I enjoy the opportunities and challenges that new working environments or projects bring and am undaunted by the unknown. [PROVIDE EXAMPLE]
